<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A sequence \(\{x_n\}\) is a <i>Cauchy sequence</i> if for every \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists an M &isin; N such that for all n &ge; M and all k &ge; M, we have \(|x_n - x_k| < \epsilon\)</li>

When we get to the partial sums of the harmonic series, we will have a sequence such that \(x_{n+1} - x_n = \frac{1}{n}\), yet \(\{x_n\}\) is divergent. In fact, for that sequence, \(\lim_{n\to\infty}|x_{n+j} - x_n| = 0\) for every \(j \in \mathbb{N}\). <b><i>The key point in the definition of Cauchy is that n and k vary independently and can be arbitrarily far apart.</i></b></li>
<li>The statement of this proposition is sometimes used to define the completeness property of the real numbers. We say a set is <i>Cauchy-complete</i> (or sometimes just <i>complete</i>) if every Cauchy sequence converges. One can construct R via "completing" Q by "throwing in" just enough points to make all Cauchy sequences converge. The resulting field has the least-upper-bound property. The advantage of using Cauchy sequences to define completeness is that this idea generalizes to more abstract settings such as metric spaces.</li>

Given a sequence \(\{x_n\}\), we write the formal object \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n\) or sometimes just \(\sum x_n\) and call it a series.

<li><i>Taylor's theorem</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition:
For an n times differentiable function f defined near a point \(x_0 \in R\), define the \(nth\) order Taylor polynomial for f at \(x_0\) as
\[P_n^{x_0}(x):= \sum_{k=0}^n\dfrac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k\]

<li><i>Theorem (Taylor)</i>:
<i>Taylor's theorem is a generalization of the mean value theorem</i>.
Suppose \(f : [a,b] \to R\) is a function with n continuous derivatives on \([a,b]\) and such that \(f^{(n+1)}\) exists on \((a,b)\). Given distinct points \(x_0\) and \(x\) in \([a,b]\), we can find a point \(c\) between \(x_0\) and \(x\) such that
\[f(x) = P_n^{x_0}(x)+ \dfrac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}.\]
The term \(R_n^{x_0}(x):= \dfrac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}\) is called \(\textit{the remainder term}\). This form of the remainder term is called the \(\textit{Lagrange form}\) of the remainder. There are other ways to write the remainder term.</li>
<li><i>Taylor's series:</i>
If \(f\) is infinitely differentiable, that is, if \(f\) can be differentiated any number of times, then we define the Taylor series:
\[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k\]
There is no guarantee that this series converges for any \(x \neq x_0\). <b><i>And even where it does converge, there is no guarantee that it converges to the function f</i></b>. Functions f whose Taylor series at every point \(x_0\) converges to f in some open interval containing \(x_0\) are called <i>analytic functions</i>.

<li><i>Pointwise and uniform convergence</i>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Pointwise convergence:</i>
For every \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(f_n : S \to R\) be a function. The sequence ${f<sub>n</sub>}<sub>n=1</sub>^&infin; converges pointwise to \(f: S \to R\) if for every \(x \in S\), we have
\[f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty}f_n(x).\]
Limits of sequences of numbers are unique, and so if a sequence ${f<sub>n</sub>} converges pointwise, the limit function \(f\) is unique. It is common to say that \(f_n : S \to R\) converges to \(f\) on \(T \subset S\) for some \(f: T \to R\). In that case we mean \(f(x) = \lim f_n(x)\) for every \(x \in T\). In other words, the restrictions of \(f_n\) to \(T\) converge pointwise to \(f\) .</li>
<li><i>Uniform convergence:</i>
Let \(f_n: S \to R\) and \(f: S \to R\) be functions. The sequence \({f_n}\) converges uniformly to \(f\) if for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), we have
\[|f_n(x)- f(x)| < \epsilon \text{ for all } x \in S.\]
In uniform convergence, N cannot depend on x (different from pointwise convergence). Given \(\epsilon > 0\), we must find an N that works for all \(x \in S\).h</li>
<li><i>Convergence in uniform norm:</i>
Let \(f: S \to R\) be a bounded function. Define
\[\|f\|_u := sup\{|f(x)| : x \in S\}.\]
We call \(\|.\|_u\) the uniform norm.
To use this notation and this concept, the domain S must be fixed. Some authors use the notation \(\|f\|_S\) to emphasize the dependence on \(S\).</li>
<li>Proposistion:
A sequence of bounded functions \(f_n: S \to R\) converges uniformly to \(f: S \to R\), if and only if
\[\lim_{n\to\infty} \|f_n - f|\|_u = 0.\]</li>
<li><i>uniformly Cauchy:</i>
Let \(f_n: S \to R\) be bounded functions. The sequence is <i>Cauchy in the uniform norm</i> or <i>uniformly Cauchy</i> if for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for all \(m,k \geq N\), \(\|f_m - f_k\|_u < \epsilon\) (for all x &isin; S)</li>
<li>Proposistion:
Let \(f_n: S \to R\) be bounded functions. Then \({f_n}\) is Cauchy in the uniform norm if and only if there exists an \(f: S \to R\) and \({f_n}\) converges uniformly to \(f\).</li>

<li><i>Interchange of limits:</i>

<li><i>Continuity of the limit:</i>
\[\textit{we asking this question: } \lim_{k\to\infty}f(x_k) = \lim_{k\to\infty}(\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x_k)) =? \lim_{n\to\infty}(\lim_{k\to\infty}f_n(x_k)) = \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x) = f(x)\]
(Theorem) Suppose \(S \subset R\). Let \({f_n}\) be a sequence of continuous functions \(f_n: S \to R\) converging uniformly to \(f: S \to R\). Then \(f\) is continuous.</li>
<li><i>Intergral of the limit:</i>
Theorem: Let \({f_n}\) be a sequence of Riemann integrable functions \(f_n: [a,b] \to R\) converging uniformly to \(f: [a,b] \to R\). Then \(f\) is Riemann integrable, and \(\int_a^b f = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_a^b f_n\).</li>
<li><i>Derivative of the limit:</i><br />
While uniform convergence is enough to swap limits with integrals, it is not, however, enough to swap limits with derivatives, unless you also have uniform convergence of the derivatives themselves.<br />
Let \(I\) be a <i>bounded interval</i> and let \(f_n: I \to R\) be continuously differentiable functions. Suppose \({f'_n}\) converges uniformly to \(g: I \to R\), and suppose \(\{f_n(c)\}_{n=1}^\infty\) is a convergent sequence for some \(c \in I\). Then \({f_n}\) converges uniformly to a continuously differentiable function \(f: I \to R\), and \(f' = g\).<br />
The proof goes through without boundedness of \(I\), except for the uniform convergence of \(f_n\) to \(f\). As an example suppose \(I = R\) and let \(f_n(x):= \dfrac{x}{n}\). Then \(f'_n(x) = \dfrac{1}{n}\), which converges uniformly to \(0\). However, \({f_n}\) converges to \(0\) only pointwise.</li>
<li><i>Convergence of power series:</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Proposition:
Let \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n\) be a convergent power series with a radius of convergence \(\rho\), where \(0 < \rho \leq \infty\). Then the series converges uniformly in \([a-r,a+r]\) whenever \(0 < r < \rho\). In particular, the series defines a continuous function on \((a-r,a+r)\) (if \(\rho < \infty\)), or \(\mathbb{R}\) (if \(\rho = \infty\)).</li>
<li>Corollary:
Let \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n\) be a convergent power series with a radius of convergence \(0 < \rho \leq \infty\). Let \(I:= (a-\rho,a+\rho)\) if \(\rho < \infty\) or \(I:= \mathbb{R}\) if \(\rho = \infty\). Let \(f: I \to \mathbb{R}\) be the limit. Then
\[\int_a^x f = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{c_{n-1}}{n}(x-a)^n,\]
where the radius of convergence of this series is at least \(\rho\).</li>

<li>Definition:
(Informal) We define a set A to be any unordered collection of objects, e.g., {3, 8, 5, 2} is a set. If x is an object, we say that x is an element of A or \(x \in A\) if x lies in the collection; otherwise we say that \(x \notin A\). For instance, \(3 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) but \(7 \notin \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).<br />
<b>Axiom 1</b>: (Sets are objects). If A is a set, then A is also an object. In particular, given two sets A and B, it is meaningful to ask whether A is also an element of B.<br />
<b>Axiom 2</b>: (Equality of sets). Two sets A and B are equal, A = B, iff every element of A is an element of B and vice versa. To put it another way, A = B if and only if every element x of A belongs also to B, and every element y of B belongs also to A.<br />
<b>Axiom 3</b>: (Empty set). There exists a set \(\emptyset\), known as the empty set, which contains no elements, i.e., for every object \(x\) we have \(x \notin \emptyset\). The empty set is also denoted {}.<br />
<b>Axiom 4</b>: (Singleton sets and pair sets). If a is an object, then there exists a set {a} whose only element is a, i.e., for every object y, we have y &isin; {a} if and only if y = a; we refer to {a} as the singleton set whose element is a. Furthermore, if a and b are objects, then there exists a set {a, b} whose only elements are a and b; i.e., for every object y, we have y &isin; {a, b} if and only if y = a or y = b; we refer to this set as the pair set formed by a and b.<br />
<b>Axiom 5</b>: (Pairwise union). Given any two sets A, B, there exists a set A ‚à™ B, called the union of A and B, which consists of all the elements which belong to A or B or both.<br />
<b>Axiom 6</b>: (Axiom of specification). Let A be a set, and for each x &isin; A, let P(x) be a property pertaining to x (i.e., for each x &isin; A, P(x) is either a true statement or a false statement). Then there exists a set, called {x &isin; A : P(x) is true} (or simply {x &isin; A : P(x)} for short), whose elements are precisely the elements x in A for which P(x) is true. In other words, for any object y, y &isin; {x in A : P(x) is true} &lt;=&gt; (y &isin; A and P(y) is true). This axiom is also known as the <i>axiom of separation.</i> We sometimes write {x &isin; A | P(x)} instead of {x &isin; A : P(x)}<br />
<b>Axiom 7</b>: (Replacement). Let A be a set. For any object x &isin; A, and any object y, suppose we have a statement P(x, y) pertaining to x and y, such that for each x &isin; A there is at most one y for which P(x, y) is true. Then there exists a set {y : P(x, y) is true for some x &isin; A}, such that for any object z, z &isin; {y : P(x, y) is true for some x &isin; A} &lt;=&gt; P(x, z) is true for some x &isin; A.<br />
<b>Axiom 8</b>: (Infinity). There exists a set N, whose elements are called natural numbers, as well as an object 0 in N, and an object n++ assigned to every natural number n &isin; N, such that the Peano axioms hold.</li>

<li><b>Axiom 9</b>:(Universal specification). (<i>Dangerous!</i>) Suppose for every object x we have a property P(x) pertaining to x (so that for every x, P(x) is either a true statement or a false statement). Then there exists a set {x : P(x) is true} such that for every object y,<br />
y &isin; {x : P(x) is true} &harr; P(y) is true.<br />
This axiom is also known as the <i>axiom of comprehension</i>. It asserts that every property corresponds to a set; if we assumed that axiom, we could talk about the set of all blue objects, the set of all natural numbers, the set of all sets, and so forth. This axiom also implies most of the axioms in the previous section. Unfortunately, <b><i>this axiom cannot be introduced into set theory, because it creates a logical contradiction known as Russell‚Äôs paradox.</i></b></li>
<li><b>Axiom 10</b> (Regularity). If A is a non-empty set, then there is at least one element x of A which is either not a set, or is disjoint from A.<br />
The point of this axiom (which is also known as the axiom of foundation) is that it is asserting that at least one of the elements of A is so low on the hierarchy of objects that it does not contain any of the other elements of A. One particular consequence of this axiom is that sets are no longer allowed to contain themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Functions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Axiom 11</b>: (Power set axiom). Let X and Y be sets. Then there exists a set, denoted Y<sup>X</sup>, which consists of all the functions from X to Y , thus f &isin; Y &harr; Y<sup>X</sup> ( f is a function with domain X and codomain Y ).<br />
<i>The reason we use the notation Y<sup>X</sup> to denote this set is that if Y has n elements and X has m elements, then one can show that Y X has n<sup>m</sup> elements.</i><br />
The set {Y : Y is a subset of X} is known as the power set of X and is denoted 2<sup>X</sup>. For instance, if a, b, c are distinct objects, we have 2<sup>{a,b,c}</sup> = {‚àÖ, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}.</li>
<li><b>Axiom 12</b>: (Union). Let A be a set, all of whose elements are themselves sets. Then there exists a set \(\bigcup\) A whose elements are precisely those objects which are elements of the elements of A, thus for all objects x, x &isin; \(\bigcup\) A &harr; (x &isin; S for some S &isin; A).</li>
<li><b>Remark</b>: The axioms of set theory that we have introduced (Axioms 1 - 12, excluding the dangerous Axiom 9) are known as the <i>Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel axioms of set theory</i>. There is one further axiom we will eventually need, the famous <i>axiom of choice</i>, giving rise to the <i>Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel‚ÄìChoice (ZFC) axioms of set theory</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cardinality
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition 1: (Equal cardinality) We say that two sets X and Y have equal cardinality iff there exists a bijection f : X ‚Üí Y from X to Y.</li>
<li>Definition 2: Let n be a natural number. A set X is said to have cardinality n, iff it has equal cardinality with {i &isin; N : 1 &le; i &le; n}. We also say that X has n elements iff it has cardinality n.</li>
<li>Definition (Finite sets). A set is finite iff it has cardinality n for some natural number n; otherwise, the set is called infinite. If X is a finite set, we use <b><i>#(X)</i></b> to denote the cardinality of X.</li>

A metric space (X, d) is a space X of objects (called points), together with a <i>distance function</i> or <i>metric</i> \(d:X \times X \to [0, +\infty)\), which associates to each pair x, y of points in X a non-negative real number d(x, y) &ge; 0.

(a) For any x &isin; X, we have d(x, x) = 0.<br />
(b) (Positivity) For any distinct x, y &isin; X, we have d(x, y) &gt; 0.<br />
(c) (Symmetry) For any x, y &isin; X, we have d(x, y) = d(y, x).<br />

When it is clear what the metric space \((X, d)\) is, we shall abbreviate \(B_{(X,d)}(x_0, r)\) as just \(B(x_0, r)\).</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Interior, exterior, boundary)</i>
Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, let \(E\) be a subset of \(X\), and let \(x_0\) be a point in \(X\). We say that \(x_0\) is an interior point of \(E\) if there exists a radius \(r > 0\) such that \(B(x_0, r) \subseteq E\). We say that \(x_0\) is an exterior point of \(E\) if there exists a radius \(r > 0\) such that \(B(x_0, r) \cap E = \varnothing\). We say that \(x_0\) is a boundary point of \(E\) if it is neither an interior point nor an exterior point of \(E\). The set of all interior points of \(E\) is called the interior of \(E\) and is sometimes denoted \(int(E)\). The set of exterior points of \(E\) is called the exterior of \(E\) and is sometimes denoted \(ext(E)\). The set of boundary points of E is called the boundary of E and is sometimes denoted \(\partial E\).</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Closure)</i>
Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, let \(E\) be a subset of \(X\), and let \(x_0\) be a point in \(X\). We say that \(x_0\) is an adherent point of \(E\) if for every radius \(r > 0\), the ball \(B(x_0, r)\) has a non-empty intersection with \(E\). <i>The set of all adherent points of \(E\) is called the closure of \(E\)</i> and is denoted \(\overline{E}\).<br />
<i>*note:</i> every points of E are adherent points, including isolated points.</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Open and closed sets)</i>
Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, and let \(E\) be a subset of \(X\). We say that \(E\) is closed if it contains all of its boundary points. We say that \(E\) is open if it contains none of its boundary points. <i>If E contains some of its boundary points but not others, then it is neither open nor closed.</i><br />
<i>*note:</i> It is possible for a set to be simultaneously open and closed, if it has no boundary.<br />

<li>Proposition:
Let \((x^{(n)})_{n=m}^\infty\) be a sequence of points in a metric space \((X, d)\), and let \(L \in X\). Then the following are equivalent:<br />
(i) \(L\) is a limit point of \((x^{(n)})_{n=m}^\infty\).<br />
(ii) There exists a subsequence \((x^{(n_j)})_{j=1}^\infty\) of the original sequence \((x^{(n)})_{n=m}^\infty\) which converges to \(L\).<br />
<i>*Note:</i> Limit points is not always converge points.<br />
<i>*Note2:</i> "limit point of a set" is synonymous with "cluster/accumulation point of a set", this is not true for sequences (nor nets or filters). That is, the term "limit point of a sequence" is not synonymous with "cluster/accumulation point of a sequence". The limit points of a set should not be confused with adherent points (also called points of closure). A limit point can be characterized as an adherent point that is not an isolated point.</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Cauchy sequences)</i>
Let \((x^{(n)})_{n=m}^\infty\) be a sequence of points in a metric space \((X, d)\). We say that this sequence is a Cauchy sequence iff for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(N \geq m\) such that \(d(x^{(j)}, x^{(k)}) < \epsilon\) for all \(j, k \geq N\).</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Complete metric spaces)</i>
A metric space \((X, d)\) is said to be complete iff every Cauchy sequence in \((X, d)\) is in fact convergent in \((X, d)\).</li>
<li>Proposition:<br />
(a) Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, and let \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) be a subspace of \((X, d)\). If \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) is complete, then \(Y\) must be closed in \(X\).<br />
(b) Conversely, suppose that \((X, d)\) is a complete metric space, and \(Y\) is a closed subset of \(X\). Then the subspace \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) is also complete.<br />
<i>*Note:</i> In contrast, an incomplete metric space such as \((Q, d)\) may be considered closed in some spaces (for instance, \(Q\) is closed in \(Q\)) but not in others (for instance, \(Q\) is not closed in \(R\)). Indeed, it turns out that given any incomplete metric space \((X, d)\), there exists a <i>completion</i> \((\overline{X},\overline{d})\), which is a larger metric space containing \((X, d)\) which is complete, and such that \(X\) is not closed in \(\overline{X}\) (indeed, the closure of \(X\) in \((\overline{X}, \overline{d})\) will be all of \(X\)).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compact Metric spaces
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition <i>(Compactness)</i>
A metric space \((X, d)\) is said to be compact iff every sequence in \((X, d)\) has at least one convergent subsequence. A subset \(Y\) of a metric space \(X\) is said to be compact if the subspace \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) is compact.</li>
<li>Remark:
The notion of a set \(Y\) being compact is <i>intrinsic</i>, in the sense that it only depends on the metric function $d|<sub>Y &times; Y</sub> restricted to \(Y\), and not on the choice of the ambient space \(X\). The notions of completeness, and of boundedness, are also intrinsic, but the notions of open and closed are not.</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Bounded sets)</i>
Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, and let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\). We say that \(Y\) is bounded iff for every \(x \in X\) there exists a ball \(B(x, r)\) in \(X\) of some finite radius \(r\) which contains \(Y\) . We call the metric space \((X, d)\) bounded if \(X\) is bounded.</li>
<li>Proposition:
Let \((X, d)\) be a compact metric space. Then \((X, d)\) is both complete and bounded.</li>
<li>Theorem <i>(Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem)</i>
Let \((R_n, d)\) be a Euclidean space with either the Euclidean metric, the taxicab metric, or the sup norm metric. Let E be a subset of \(R_n\). Then \(E\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.<br />
<i>*Note:</i> However, the Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem is not true for more general metrics. For instance, the integer Z with the discrete metric is closed (indeed, it is complete) and bounded, but not compact, since the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . is in Z but has no convergent subsequence.</li>

A topological space is a pair \((X, F)\), where \(X\) is a set and \(F \subseteq 2^X\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\), whose elements are referred to as <i>open sets</i>. Furthermore, the collection \(F\) must obey the following properties:<br />
‚Ä¢ The empty set \(\varnothing\) and the whole set \(X\) are open; in other words, \(\varnothing \in F\) and \(X \in F\).<br />
‚Ä¢ Any finite intersection of open sets is open.<br />

<i>*Note:</i> This notion is consistent with that of convergence in metric spaces. One can then ask whether one has the basic property of uniqueness of limits.

<li>Theorem <i>(Weierstrass M-test)</i>
Let (X, d) be a metric space, and let \((f^{(n)})_{n=1}^\infty\) be a sequence of bounded real-valued continuous functions on X such that the series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|f^{(n)}\|_\infty\)  is convergent. (Note that this is a series of plain old real numbers, not of functions.) Then the series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|f^{(n)}\|_\infty\) converges uniformly to some function f on X, and that function f is also continuous.<br />
<i>*Note:</i> \(\|f\|_\infty\) is the <i>sup norm</i> or <i>uniform norm</i>.</li>
<li>Uniform Approximation by Polynomials
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Theorem <i>(Weierstrass approximation theorem)</i>
If [a, b] is an interval, f:[a, b] &rarr; R is a continuous function, and &epsilon; &gt; 0, then there exists a polynomial P on [a, b] such that \(d_\infty(P, f ) \leq \varepsilon\) (i.e., \(|P(x) ‚àí f(x)| \leq \varepsilon\) for all x &isin; [a, b]).</li>
<li>Remark: Another way of stating this theorem is as follows. Recall that C([a, b] &rarr; R) was the space of continuous functions from [a, b] to R, with the uniform metric d<sub>&infin;</sub>. Let P([a, b] &rarr; R) be the space of all polynomials on [a, b]; this is a subspace of C([a, b] &rarr; R), since all polynomials are continuous. The Weierstrass approximation theorem then asserts that every continuous function is an adherent point of P([a, b] &rarr; R); or in other words, that the closure of the space of polynomials is the space of continuous functions: \(\overline{P([a, b] \to R)} = C([a, b] \to R)\).<br />
In particular, every continuous function on [a, b] is the uniform limit of polynomials. Another way of saying this is that the space of polynomials is dense in the space of continuous functions, in the uniform topology.</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Compactly supported functions)</i>
Let [a, b] be an interval. A function f:R &rarr; R is said to be supported on [a, b] if f(x) = 0 for all x &notin; [a, b]. We say that f is compactly supported if it is supported on some interval [a, b]. If f is continuous and supported on [a, b], we define the improper integral \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty f\) to be \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty f := \int_{[a,b]} f\).</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Approximation to the identity)</i>
Let &epsilon; &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; &delta; &lt; 1. A function f : R &rarr; R is said to be an (&epsilon;, &delta; )-approximation to the identity if it obeys the following three properties:<br />
(a) f is supported on [‚àí1, 1], and f (x) &ge; 0 for all ‚àí1 &le; x &le; 1.<br />
(b) f is continuous, and \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty f = 1\).<br />
(c) |f(x)| &le; &epsilon; for all &delta; &le; |x| &le; 1.</li>
<li><b><i>Our proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem relies on three key facts</i></b></li>
<li><b>Fact 1</b> - <i>(Lemma - Polynomials can approximate the identity)</i>
For every &epsilon; &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; &delta; &lt; 1 there exists an (&epsilon;, &delta; )-approximation to the identity which is a polynomial P on [‚àí1, 1].</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Convolution)</i>
Let f : R &rarr; R and g : R &rarr; R be continuous, compactly supported functions. We define the convolution f‚àóg: R &rarr; R of f and g to be the function \((f‚àóg)(x):= \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y)g(x - y)dy\).</li>
<li><i>(Basic properties of convolution)</i>
Let f: R &rarr; R, g: R &rarr; R,and h: R &rarr; R be continuous, compactly supported functions. Then the following statements are true.<br />
(a) The convolution f ‚àó g is also a continuous, compactly supported function.<br />
(b) (Convolution is commutative) We have f ‚àó g = g ‚àó f.<br />
(c) (Convolution is linear) We have f ‚àó (g + h) = f ‚àó g + f ‚àó h. Also, for any real number c, we have f ‚àó (cg) = (cf ) ‚àó g = c( f ‚àó g).</li>
<li><b>Fact 2</b> - <i>(Lema convolution with polynomials produces another polynomial)</i>:
Let f: R ‚Üí R be a continuous function supported on [0, 1], and let g: R ‚Üí R be a continuous function supported on [‚àí1, 1] which is a polynomial on [‚àí1, 1]. Then f ‚àó g is a polynomial on [0, 1]. <i>(Note however that it may be non-polynomial outside of [0, 1].)</i></li>
<li><b>Fact 3</b>: <i>If one convolves a uniformly continuous function with an approximation to the identity, we obtain a new function which is close to the original function (which explains the terminology ‚Äúapproximation to the identity‚Äù)</i><br />
Lemma - Let f: R &rarr; R be a continuous function supported on [0, 1], which is bounded by some M &gt; 0 (i.e., |f(x)| &le; M for all x &isin; R), and let &epsilon; &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; &delta; &lt; 1 be such that one has |f(x)-f(y)| &lt; &epsilon; whenever x, y &isin; R and |x-y| &lt; &delta; . Let g be any (&epsilon;, &delta; )-approximation to the identity. Then we have |f ‚àó g(x) - f(x)| ‚â§ (1 + 4M)&epsilon; for all x &isin; [0, 1].</li>
<li>Corollary <i>(Weierstrass approximation theorem I)</i>
Let f: R &rarr; R be a continuous function supported on [0, 1]. Then for every &epsilon; &gt; 0, there exists a function P: R &rarr; R which is polynomial on [0, 1] and such that |P(x) - f(x)| &le; &epsilon; for all x &isin; [0, 1].</li>
<li>Lemma <i>(the extension of f by zero)</i>:
Let f: [0, 1] &rarr; R be a continuous function which equals 0 on the boundary of [0, 1], i.e., f(0) = f(1) = 0. Let F: R &rarr; R be the function defined by setting F(x) := f(x) for x &isin; [0, 1] and F(x) := 0 for x &notin; [0, 1]. Then F is also continuous.</li>
<li>Corollary <i>(Weierstrass approximation theorem II)</i>
Let f: [0, 1] &rarr; R be a continuous function such that f(0) = f(1) = 0. Then for every &epsilon; &gt; 0 there exists a polynomial P: [0, 1] &rarr; R such that |P(x) - f(x)| &le; &epsilon; for all x &isin; [0, 1].</li>
<li>Corollary <i>(Weierstrass approximation theorem III)</i>
Let f: [0, 1] &rarr; R be a continuous function. Then for every &epsilon; &gt; 0 there exists a polynomial P: [0, 1] &rarr; R such that |P(x) - f(x)| &le; &epsilon; for all x &isin; [0, 1].</li>
<li><i>Proof of Theorem</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let f: [a, b] ‚Üí R be a continuous function on [a, b]. Let g: [0, 1] &rarr; R denote the function g(x):= f(a + (b ‚àí a)x) for all x &isin;  [0, 1].</li>
<li>Observe then that f(y) = g((y ‚àí a)/(b ‚àí a)) for all y &isin; [a, b].</li>
<li>The function g is continuous on [0, 1] (why?), and so by previous Corollary we may find a polynomial Q: [0, 1] &rarr; R such that |Q(x) - g(x)| &le; &epsilon; for all x &isin; [0, 1]. In particular, for any y &isin; [a, b], we have</li>
<li>|Q((y ‚àí a)/(b ‚àí a)) ‚àí g((y ‚àí a)/(b ‚àí a))| &le; &epsilon;</li>
<li>If we thus set P(y):= Q((y ‚àí a)/(b ‚àí a)), then we observe that P is also a polynomial (why?), and so we have |P(y) ‚àí f(y)| &le; &epsilon; for all y &isin; [a, b], as desired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Remark 1</i>:
Note that the Weierstrass approximation theorem only works on bounded intervals [a, b]; continuous functions on R cannot be uniformly approximated by polynomials. For instance, the exponential function f: R ‚Üí R defined by \(f(x) := e^x\) cannot be approximated by any polynomial, because exponential functions grow faster than any polynomial and so there is no way one can even make the sup metric between f and a polynomial finite.</li>

<li>Real Analytic Functions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition <i>(Real analytic functions)</i> Let E be a subset of R, and let f: E &rarr; R be a function. If <i>a</i> is an interior point of E, we say that f is <i>real analytic at a</i> if there exists an open interval <i>(a ‚àí r, a + r)</i> in E for some r &gt; 0 such that there exists a power series \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x ‚àí a)^n\) centered at <i>a</i> which has a radius of convergence greater than or equal to r and which converges to f on <i>(a ‚àí r, a + r)</i>. If E is an open set, and f is real analytic at every point a of E, we say that f is <i>real analytic on E</i>.</li>
<li>Example: Consider the function \(f: R\backslash \{1\}\) to R defined by f(x):= 1/(1 ‚àí x). This function is real analytic at 0 because we have a power series \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n\) centered at 0 which converges to 1/(1 ‚àí x) = f(x) on the interval (‚àí1, 1). This function is also real analytic at 2 because we have a power series \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty (‚àí1)^{n+1}(x ‚àí 2)^n\) which converges to \(\frac{-1}{1‚àí(-(x‚àí2))} = \frac{1}{1-x} = f(x)\) on the interval (1, 3). In fact this function is real analytic on all of \(R\backslash \{1\}\);</li>
<li>Corollary <i>(Taylor‚Äôs formula)</i>
Let E be a subset of R, let <i>a</i> be an interior point of E, and let \(f: E \to R\) be a function which is real analytic at a and has the power series expansion \(f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x ‚àí a)^n\) for all x &isin; <i>(a ‚àí r, a + r)</i> and some r &gt; 0. Then for any integer k &ge; 0, we have \(f^{(k)}(a) = k!c_k\). In particular, we have <i>Taylor‚Äôs formula</i> \(f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x ‚àí a)^n\) for all x in <i>(a ‚àí r, a + r).</i><br />
/*Note:/Note that Taylor‚Äôs formula only works for functions which are real analytic; there are examples of functions which are infinitely differentiable but for which Taylor‚Äôs theorem fails. Another important corollary of Taylor‚Äôs formula is that a real analytic function</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>
can have at most one power series at a point. While a real analytic function has a unique power series around any given point, it can certainly have different power series at different points.

<li>Periodic Functions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition:
Let L &gt; 0 be a real number. A function \(f: R \to C\) is periodic with period L, or L-periodic, if we have \(f(x + L) = f(x)\) for every real number x.<br />
Note: In particular, if a function f is 1-periodic, then we have f(x + k) = f(x) for every k &isin; Z. Because of this, 1-periodic functions are sometimes also called Z-periodic (and L-periodic functions called LZ-periodic).</li>
<li>Notation: The space of complex-valued continuous <b>Z</b>-periodic functions is denoted C(<b>R/Z;C</b>). (The notation <b>R/Z</b> comes from algebra, and denotes the quotient group of the additive group <b>R</b> by the additive group <b>Z</b>). By ‚Äúcontinuous‚Äù we mean continuous at all points on <b>R</b>; merely being continuous on an interval such as [0, 1] will not suffice, as theremay be a discontinuity between the left and right limits at 1 (or at any other integer).</li>
<li>Lemma <i>(Basic properties of C(<b>R/Z;C</b>))</i><br />

(b) <i>(Vector space and algebra properties)</i> If f, g &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>), then the functions f + g, f ‚àí g, and f g are also in C(<b>R/Z;C</b>). Also, if c is any complex number, then the function cf is also in C(<b>R/Z;C</b>).<br />
(c) <i>(Closure under uniform limits)</i> If \((f_n)_{n=1}^\infty\) is a sequence of functions in C(<b>R/Z;C</b>) which converges uniformly to another function \(f:R \to C\), then f is also in C(<b>R/Z;C</b>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inner Products on Periodic Functions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition <i>(Inner product)</i>
If f, g &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>), we define the inner produc \(\langle f,g \rangle\) to be the quantity \(\langle f,g \rangle  = \int_{[0,1]}f(x)\overline{g(x)}dx\).<br />
Note:  In order to integrate a complex-valued function, \(f(x) = g(x) + ih(x)\), we use the definition that \(\int_{[a,b]}f:= \int_{[a,b]}g + i\int_{[a,b]}h\); i.e., we integrate the real and imaginary parts of the function separately.</li>
<li>Lemma: Let f, g, h &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>).<br />
(a) <i>(Hermitian property)</i> We have \(\langle g,f \rangle = \overline{\langle f,g \rangle}\).<br />
(b) <i>(Positivity)</i> We have \(\langle f,f \rangle \geq 0\). Furthermore, we have \(\langle f,f \rangle = 0\) if and only if f = 0 (i.e., f(x) = 0 for all x &isin; R).<br />
(c) <i>(Linearity in the first variable)</i> We have \(\langle f + g, h \rangle = \langle f,h \rangle + \langle g,h \rangle\). For any complex number c, we have \(\langle cf,g \rangle = c\langle f,g \rangle\).<br />
(d) <i>(Antilinearity in the second variable)</i> We have  \(\langle f , g + h \rangle = \langle f,g \rangle + \langle f,h \rangle\). For any complex number c, we have \(\langle cf,g \rangle = \overline{c}\langle f,g \rangle\).</li>
<li>Definition: <i>L<sup>2</sup> norm ||f||<sub>2</sub> of a function f &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>)</i>
\[ \|f\|_2:=\sqrt{\langle f,f\rangle} = \left(\int_{[0,1]}f(x)\overline{f(x)}dx\right)^{1/2} = \left(\int_{[0,1]}|f(x)|^2 dx\right)^{1/2} \]
Thus ||f||<sub>2</sub> &ge; 0 for all f . The norm ||f||<sub>2</sub> is sometimes called the <i>root mean square of f</i>.<br />
*Remark: This \(L^2\) norm isrelated to, but is distinctfrom, the \(L^\infty\) norm \(\|f\|_\infty := sup_{x\in R} |f(x)|\). For instance, if \(f(x) = \sin{(2\pi x)}\), then \(\|f\|_\infty = 1\) but \(\|f\|_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). In general, the best one can say is that \(0 \leq \|f\|_2 \leq \|f\|_infty\).</li>
<li>Lema <i>(Some basic properties of the L<sup>2</sup> norm)</i>:
Let f, g &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>).<br />
(a) <i>(Non-degeneracy)</i> We have \(\|f\|_2 = 0\) if and only if \(f=0\).<br />
(b) <i>(Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality)</i> We have \(|\langle f, g \rangle | \leq \| f\|_2 \|g\|_2\).<br />
(c) <i>(Triangle inequality)</i> We have \(\|f + g\|_2 \leq \|f\|_2 + \|g\|_2\).<br />
(d) <i>(Pythagoras‚Äô theorem)</i> If \(\langle f,g \rangle = 0\), then \|f + g\|<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = \|f\|<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + \|g\|<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>$. In light of Pythagoras‚Äô theorem, we sometimes say that f and g are <i>orthogonal</i>.<br />
(e) <i>(Homogeneity)</i> We have \(\|cf\|_2 = |c|\|f\|_2\) for all \(c \in C\).</li>
<li>Definition <i>(L<sup>2</sup> metric d<sub>L<sup>2</sup></sub> on C(<b>R/Z;C</b>)</i>
\[d_{L^2}(f,g):= \|f ‚àí g\|_2 = \left(\int_{[0,1]}|f(x) ‚àí g(x)|^2 dx\right)^{1/2}.\]
<i>The L<sup>2</sup> metric is very similar to the l<sup>2</sup> metric on Euclidean spaces Rn, which is why the notation is deliberately chosen to be similar.</i></li>
<li>Remark:<br />
(a) Note that a sequence f<sub>n</sub> of functions in C(<b>R/Z;C</b>) will converge in the L<sup>2</sup> metric to f &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>) if \(d_{L^2}(f_n,f) \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\), or in other words that \(\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{[0,1]}|f_n(x) ‚àí f(x)|^2 dx = 0\).<br />
(b) The notion of convergence in L<sup>2</sup> metric is different from that of uniform or pointwise convergence.<br />
(c) The L<sup>2</sup> metric is not as well-behaved as the \(L^\infty\) metric. For instance, it turns out the space C(<b>R/Z;C</b>) is not complete in the L<sup>2</sup> metric, despite being complete in the \(L^\infty\) metric.</li>

<li>Trigonometric Polynomials
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition <i>(Characters)</i>
For every integer n, we let <i>e<sub>n</sub></i> &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>) denote the function \(e_n(x):=e^{2\pi inx}\). This is sometimes referred to as the <i>character with frequency n</i>.</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Trigonometric polynomials)</i>
A function \(f\) in C(<b>R/Z;C</b>) is said to be a trigonometric polynomial if we can write \(f=\sum_{n=-N}^N c_ne_n\) for some integer N &ge; 0 and some complex numbers \((c_n)_{n=‚àíN}^N\).</li>
<li>Lemma <i>(Characters are an orthonormal system)</i>
For any integers n and m, we have \(\langle e_n, e_m \rangle = 1\) when n = m and \(\langle e_n, e_m \rangle = 0\) when n &ne; m. Also, we have \(\|e_n\| = 1\).</li>
<li>Corollary:
Let \(f = \sum_{n=‚àíN}^N c_ne_n\) be a trigonometric polynomial. Then we have the formula \(c_n = \langle f, e_n \rangle\) for all integers ‚àíN &le; n &le; N. Also, we have \(0 = \langle f, e_n \rangle\) whenever n &gt; N or n &lt; ‚àíN. Also, we have the identity \(\|f\|_2^2 = \sum_{n=‚àíN}^N |c_n|^2\).</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Fourier transform)</i>
For any function \(f\) &isin; C(<b>R/Z;R</b>), and any integer n &isin; Z, we define the \(n^{th}\) <i>Fourier coefficient of \(f\)</i> , denoted \(\hat{f}(n)\), by the formula \[\hat{f}(n):= \langle f, e_n \rangle = \int_{[0,1]} f(x)e^{‚àí2\pi inx} dx.\]
The function \(\hat{f}: Z \to C\) is called the <i>Fourier transform of f</i>.</li>
<li>Note: in particular we have the <i>Fourier inversion formula</i>
\[f = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(n)e_n\]
or in other words
\[f(x) = \sum_{n=‚àí\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(n)e^{2\pi inx}.\]
The right-hand side is referred to as the <i>Fourier series of f</i>. Also, we have the <i>Plancherel formula</i>
\[\|f\|_2^2 = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty\|\hat{f}(n)\|^2.\]
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Remark</b>: We stress that at present we have only proven the Fourier inversion and Plancherel formulae in the case when f is a trigonometric polynomial. Note that in this case that the Fourier coefficients \(\hat{f}(n)\) are mostly zero (indeed, they can only be non-zero when ‚àíN &le; n &le; N), and so this infinite sum is really just a finite sum in disguise. In particular there are no issues about what sense the above series converge in; they both converge pointwise, uniformly, and in L<sup>2</sup> metric, since they are just finite sums.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Now, we will extend the Fourier inversion and Plancherel formulae to general functions in C(R/Z; C), not just trigonometric polynomials. (It is also possible to extend the formula to discontinuous functions such as the square wave, but we will not do so here.)</i></li>

Let \(f\) &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>), and let &epsilon; &gt; 0. Then there exists a trigonometric polynomial \(P\) such that \(\|f ‚àí P\|_\infty \leq \varepsilon\).<br />
<i>*Note 1:</i> This theorem asserts that any continuous periodic function can be uniformly approximated by trigonometric polynomials. To put it another way, if we let P(<b>R/Z;C</b>) denote the space of all trigonometric polynomials, then the closure of P(<b>R/Z;C</b>) in the \(L^\infty\) metric is C(<b>R/Z;C</b>).<br />
<i>*Note 2:</i> It is possible to prove this theorem directly from the Weierstrass approximation theorem for polynomials, and both theorems are a special case of a much more general theorem known as the <i>Stone-Weierstrass theorem</i>, which we will not discuss here. However we shall instead prove this theorem from scratch, in order to introduce a couple of interesting notions, notably that of periodic convolution.</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Periodic convolution)</i>
Let \(f, g\) &isin;  C(<b>R/Z;C</b>). Then we define the <i>periodic convolution</i> \(f ‚àó g: R \to C\) of \(f\) and \(g\) by the formula
\[f ‚àó g(x):= \int_{[0,1]} f(y)g(x ‚àí y) dy.\]
<i>*Note:</i> Note that this formula is slightly different from the convolution for compactly supported functions, because we are only integrating over [0, 1] and not on all of R. Thus, in principle we have given the symbol f ‚àó g two conflicting meanings. However, in practice there will be no confusion, because it is not possible for a non-zero function to both be periodic and compactly supported.</li>
<li>Lemma <i>(Basic properties of periodic convolution)</i>
Let \(f, g, h\) &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>).<br />
(a) <i>(Closure)</i> The convolution f ‚àó g is continuous and Z-periodic. In other words, \(f ‚àó g\) &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>).<br />
(b) <i>(Commutativity)</i> We have \(f ‚àó g = g ‚àó f\).<br />
(c) <i>(Bilinearity)</i> We have \(f ‚àó (g + h) = f ‚àó g + f ‚àó h\) and \(( f + g) ‚àó h = f ‚àó h +g ‚àó h\). For any complex number \(c\), we have \(c( f ‚àó g) = (cf ) ‚àó g = f ‚àó (cg)\).</li>

Let &epsilon; &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; &delta; &lt; 1/2. A function \(f\) &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>) is said to be a <i>periodic \((\varepsilon, \delta)\) approximation to the identity</i> if the following properties are true:<br />
(a) \(f(x) \geq 0\) for all \(x \in R\), and \(\int_{[0,1]}f = 1\).<br />
(b) We have \(f(x) < \varepsilon\) for all \(\delta \leq |x| \leq 1 ‚àí \delta\).</li>
<li>Lemma:
For every &epsilon; &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; &delta; &lt; 1/2, there exists a trigonometric polynomial P which is an \((\varepsilon, \delta)\) approximation to the identity.</li>

<li>The Fourier and Plancherel Theorems
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Theorem <i>(Fourier theorem)</i>
For any f ‚àà C(<b>R/Z;C</b>), the series \(\sum_{n=‚àí\infty}^\infty\hat{f}(n)e_n\) converges in L<sup>2</sup> metric to \(f\) . In other words, we have
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}\|f ‚àí \sum_{n=-N}^N\hat{f}(n)e_n\|_2 = 0.\]</li>
<li><b>Remark</b>:
Note that we have only obtained convergence of the Fourier series \(\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty\hat{f}(n)e_n\) to \(f\) in the L<sup>2</sup> metric. One may ask whether one has convergence in the uniform or pointwise sense as well, but it turns out (perhaps somewhat surprisingly) that the answer is no to both of those questions. However, if one assumes that the function f is not only continuous, but is also differentiable, then one can recover pointwise convergence; if one assumes continuously differentiable, then one gets uniform convergence as well. These results are beyond the scope of this text and will not be proven here.</li>
<li>Theorem:
Let \(f\) &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>), and suppose that the series \(\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty|\hat{f}(n)|\) is absolutely convergent. Then the series \(\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty\hat{f}(n)e_n\) converges uniformly to \(f\). In other words, we have
\[\lim_{n\to\infty} \| f ‚àí \sum_{n=-N}^N\hat{f}(n)e_n\|_\infty= 0.\]</li>

For any \(f\) &isin; C(<b>R/Z;C</b>), the series \(\sum_{n=‚àí\infty}^\infty|\hat{f}(n)|^2\) is absolutely convergent, and

Let \(E\) be a subset of \(R^n, f: E \to R^m\) be a function, \(x_0 \in E\) be a limit point of \(E\), and let \(L: R^n \to R^m\) be a linear transformation. We say that \(f\) is differentiable at \(x_0\) with derivative \(L\) if we have
\[\lim_{x\to x_0;x\in E‚àí\{x_0\}}\frac{\|f(x) - (f(x_0)+L(x-x-x_0))\|}{\|x-x_0\|} = 0 \]
Here \(\|x\|\) is the length of \(x\) (as measured in the l<sup>2</sup> metric):
\[\|(x_1, x_2, ... , x_n)\| = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + .... + x-n^2)^{1/2}.\]</li>
<li>Lemma <i>(Uniqueness of derivatives)</i>
Let \(E\) be a subset of \(R^n, f: E \to R^m\) be a function, \(x_0 \in E\) be an interior point of \(E\), and let \(L_1: R^n \to R^m\) and \(L_2: R^n \to R^m\) be linear transformations.

<li>Partial and Directional Derivatives
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition <i>(Directional derivative)</i>
Let \(E\) be a subset of \(R^n, f: E \to R^m\) be a function, let \(x_0\) be an interior point of \(E\), and let \(v\) be a vector in \(R^n\). If the limit
\[\lim_{t\to 0;t>0,x_0+tv\in E}\frac{f(x_0 + tv) ‚àí f(x_0)}{t}\]
exists, we say that \(f\) is differentiable in the direction \(v\) at \(x_0\), and we denote the above limit by \(D_vf(x_0)\):
\[ D_vf(x_0):= \lim_{t\to 0;t>0} \frac{f(x_0 + tv) ‚àí f(x_0)}{t}.\]
<b>Remark</b>: Note that we are dividing by a scalar \(t\), rather than a vector, so this definition makes sense, and \(D_vf(x_0)\) will be a vector in \(R^m\). It is sometimes possible to also define directional derivatives on the boundary of \(E\), if the vector \(v\) is pointing in an ‚Äúinward‚Äù direction (this generalizes the notion of left derivatives and right derivatives from singlevariable calculus); but we will not pursue these matters here.</li>
<li>Lemma:
Let \(E\) be a subset of \(R^n, f: E \to R^m\) be a function, \(x_0\) be an interior point of \(E\), and let \(v\) be a vector in \(R^n\). If \(f\) is differentiable at \(x_0\), then \(f\) is also differentiable in the direction \(v\) at \(x_0\), and \(D_vf(x_0)=f'(x_0)v\).<br />
<i>*Note: One consequence of this lemma is that total differentiability implies directional differentiability. However, the converse is not true</i></li>
<li>Definition <i>(Partial derivative)</i>
Let \(E\) be a subset of \(R^n\), let \(f: E \to R^m\) be a function, let \(x_0\) be an interior point of \(E\), and let \(1 \leq j \leq n\). Then the partial derivative of \(f\) with respect to the \(x_j\) variable at \(x_0\), denoted \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x_0)\), is defined by
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x_0):= \lim_{t\to 0;t\neq 0,x_0+te_j\in E} \frac{f(x_0 + te_j) ‚àí f(x_0)}{t} = \frac{d}{dt} f(x_0 + te_j)\vert_{t=0} \]
provided of course that the limit exists. (If the limit does not exist, we leave \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x_0)\) undefined.)<br />
We say that \(f\) is <i>continuously differentiable</i> if the partial derivatives \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, ..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\)  exist and are continuous on \(E\).<br />
Informally, the partial derivative can be obtained by holding all the variables other than \(x_j\) fixed and then applying the single-variable calculus derivative in the \(x_j\) variable. Note that if \(f\) takes values in \(R^m\), then so will \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}\). Indeed, if we write \(f\) in components as \(f = (f_1,... , f_m)\), it is easy to see that
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j} (x_0) = \left( \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}(x_0), ..., \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_j}(x_0)\right),\]
i.e., to differentiate a vector-valued function one just has to differentiate each of the components separately.</li>
<li>Theorem:
Let \(E\) be a subset of \(R^n, f: E to R^m\) be a function, \(F\) be a subset of \(E\), and \(x_0\) be an interior point of \(F\). If all the partial derivatives \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}\) exist on \(F\) and are continuous at \(x_0\), then \(f\) is differentiable at \(x_0\), and the linear transformation \(f'(x0): R^n \to R^m\) is defined by
\[f'(x_0)(v_j)_{1\leq j\leq n} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j} (x0).\]</li>
<li>Remark:
If the partial derivatives of a function \(f: E \to R^m\) exist and are continuous on some set \(F\), then all the directional derivatives also exist at every interior point \(x_0\) of \(F\), and we have the formula
\[D_{(v_1,...,v_n)}f(x_0) = \sum_{j=1}^n v_j \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x_0).\]
In particular, if \(f: E \to R\) is a real-valued function, and we define the <b><i>gradient</i></b> \(\nabla f(x_0)\) of \(f\) at \(x_0\) to be the n-dimensional row vector \(\nabla f(x_0):=(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} (x_0),... , \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} (x_0))\), then we have the familiar formula
\[D_v f(x_0) = v.\nabla f(x_0)\]
whenever \(x_0\) is in the interior of the region where the gradient exists and is continuous.</li>

<li>Definition <i>(Twice continuous differentiability)</i>
Let \(E\) be an open subset of \(R^n\), and let \(f: E \to R^m\) be a function.

<li>Theorem <i>(Clairaut‚Äôs theorem)</i>
Let \(E\) be an open subset of \(R^n\), and let \(f: E \to R^m\) be a twice continuously differentiable function on \(E\). Then we have \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x_0) =\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x_0)\) for all \(1 \leq i, j \leq n\).</li>

<li>The Contraction Mapping Theorem
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition <i>(Contraction)</i>
<i>Let (X, d) be a metric space, and let f: X &rarr; X be a map. We say that f is a contraction if we have d(f(x), f(y)) &le; d(x, y) for all x, y &isin; X. We say that f is a strict contraction if there exists a constant 0 &lt; c &lt; 1 such that d(f(x), f(y)) &le; cd(x, y) for all x, y &isin; X ; we call c the contraction constant of f.</i></li>
<li>Definition <i>(Fixed points)</i>
Let f: X &rarr; X be a map, and x &isin; X . We say that x is a fixed point of f if f(x) = x.<br />
*Note: Contractions do not necessarily have any fixed points; for instance, the map f: R &rarr; R defined by f(x) = x + 1 does not. However, it turns out that strict contractions always do, at least when X is complete.</li>
<li>Theorem <i>(Contraction mapping theorem)</i>
<i>Let (X, d) be a metric space, and let f: X &rarr; X be a strict contraction. Then f can have at most one fixed point. Moreover, if we also assume that X is non-empty and complete, then f has exactly one fixed point.</i></li>
<li>Remark: We shall give one consequence of the contraction mapping theorem which is important for our application to the inverse function theorem. Basically, this says that any map f on a ball which is a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù perturbation of the identity map, remains one-to-one and cannot create any internal holes in the ball.</li>
<li>Lemma:
Let B(0, r) be a ball in R<sup>n</sup> centered at the origin, and let g: B(0, r) &rarr; R<sup>n</sup> be a map such that g(0) = 0 and ||g(x) ‚àí g(y)|| &le; 1/2||x ‚àí y|| for all x, y &isin; B(0, r) (here ||x|| denotes the length of x in R<sup>n</sup>). Then the function f: B(0, r) &rarr; R<sup>n</sup> defined by f(x):= x + g(x) is one-to-one, and furthermore the image f(B(0, r)) of this map contains the ball B(0, r/2).</li>

<li>The Inverse Function Theorem in Several Variable Calculus
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Theorem <i>(Inverse function theorem)</i>
Let \(E\) be an open subset of \(R^n\), and let \(f: E \to R^n\) be a function which is continuously differentiable on \(E\). Suppose \(x_0 \in E\) is such that the linear transformation \(f'(x_0) : R^n to R^n\) is invertible. Then there exists an open set \(U\) in \(E\) containing \(x_0\), and an open set \(V\) in \(R^n\) containing \(f(x_0)\), such that \(f\) is a bijection from \(U\) to \(V\). In particular, there is an inverse map \(f^{‚àí1} : V \to U\). Furthermore, this inverse map is differentiable at \(f(x_0)\), and
\[(f^{‚àí1})'(f(x_0)) = (f'(x_0))^{-1}.\]</li>

<li>The Implicit Function Theorem
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Theorem <i>(Implicit function theorem)</i>
Let \(E\) be an open subset of \(R^n\), let \(f: E \to R\) be continuously differentiable, and let \(y = (y_1,... , y_n)\) be a point in \(E\) such that \(f(y) = 0\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(y) \neq 0\). Then there exists an open subset \(U\) of \(R^{n‚àí1}\) containing \((y_1,... , y_{n‚àí1})\), an open subset \(V\) of \(E\) containing \(y\), and a function \(g: U \to R\) such that \(g(y_1,... , y_{n‚àí1}) = y_n\), and
\[\{(x_1,... , x_n) \in V : f(x_1,... , x_n) = 0\}\]
\[= \{(x_1,... , x_{n‚àí1}, g(x_1,... , x_{n‚àí1})) : (x_1,... , x_{n‚àí1}) \in U\}.\]
In other words, the set \(\{x \in V : f(x) = 0\}\) is a graph of a function over \(U\). Moreover, \(g\) is differentiable at \((y_1,... , y_{n‚àí1})\), and we have
\[\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_j}(y_1,... , y_{n‚àí1}) = ‚àí\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_j}(y)/\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_n}(y) \]
for all \(1 \leq j \leq n ‚àí 1\).</li>
<li>Remark:
Sets which look like graphs of continuous functions at every point have a name, they are called <i>manifolds</i>. Thus \(\{x \in R^n : f(x) = 0\}\) will be a manifold if it contains no critical points of \(f\) . The theory of manifolds is very important in modern geometry (especially differential geometry and algebraic geometry), but we will not discuss it here as it is a graduate level topic.</li>

Let \(\Omega\) be a measurable subset of \(R^n\). A measurable function \(f : \Omega \to R^‚àó\) is said to be absolutely integrable if the integral \(\int_\Omega |f|\) is finite.<br />
Of course, \(|f|\) is always non-negative, so this definition makes sense even if \(f\) changes sign. Absolutely integrable functions are also known as \(L^1(\Omega )\) functions.<br />
If \(f :\Omega \to R^‚àó\) is a function, we define the positive part \(f^+:\Omega \to [0, \infty ]\) and negative part \(f^‚àí :\Omega \to [0, \infty ]\) by the formulae \(f^+:= \max( f, 0); f^‚àí:= ‚àí \min( f, 0)\).</li>
<li>Definition <i>(Lebesgue integral)</i> Let \(f :\Omega \to R^‚àó\) be an absolutely integrable function. We define the <i>Lebesgue integral</i> \(\int_\Omega f\) of \(f\) to be the quantity
\[\int_\Omega f:= \int_\Omega f^+ - \int_\Omega f^- .\]</li>
<li>Proposition:
Let &Omega; be a measurable set, and let \(f :\Omega \to R\) and g :&Omega; &rarr; R$ be <i>absolutely integrable functions</i>.<br />
(a) For any real number c (positive, zero, or negative), we have that cf is absolutely integrable and &int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> cf = c&int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> f.<br />
(b) The function f + g is absolutely integrable, and &int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> (f + g) = &int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> f + &int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> g.<br />
(c) If f(x) &le; g(x) for all x &isin; &Omega; , then we have &int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> f &le; &int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> g.<br />
(d) If f(x) = g(x) for almost every x &isin; &Omega; , then &int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> f = &int;<sub>&Omega;</sub> g.</li>

<li>Comparison with the Riemann Integral
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Remark</b>: <i>every Riemann integrable function is also Lebesgue integrable, at least on bounded intervals. However, the converse is not true. Take for instance the function f: [0, 1] &rarr; R defined by f(x):=1 when x is rational, and f(x):=0 when x is irrational. we know that f is not Riemann integrable. On the other hand, f is the characteristic function of the set Q &cap; [0, 1], which is countable and hence measure zero. Thus f is Lebesgue integrable and \(\int_{[0,1]} f = 0\). Thus the Lebesgue integral can handle more functions than the Riemann integral; this is one of the primary reasons why we use the Lebesgue integral in analysis. The other reason is that the Lebesgue integral interacts well with limits, as the Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem, Fatou‚Äôs lemma, and Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem already attest. There are no comparable theorems for the Riemann integral.</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fubini‚Äôs Theorem
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Theorem <i>(Fubini‚Äôs theorem)</i>
Let f: R<sup>2</sup> &rarr; R be an absolutely integrable function. Then there exists absolutely integrable functions F: R &rarr; R and G: R &rarr; R such that for almost every x, f(x, y) is absolutely integrable in y with
\[F(x) = \int_R f(x, y)dy,\]
and for almost every y, f(x, y) is absolutely integrable in x with
\[G(y) = \int_R f(x, y)dx.\]
Finally, we have
\[\int_R F(x)dx = \int_{R^2} f = \int_{R^2}G(y)dy.\]</li>
<li>Remark:
Very roughly speaking, Fubini‚Äôs theorem says that
\[\int_R\left(\int_R f(x, y)dy\right)dx = \int_{R^2} f = \int_R\left(\int_R f(x, y)dx\right) dy.\]
This allows us to compute two-dimensional integrals by splitting them into two onedimensional integrals. The reason why we do not write Fubini‚Äôs theorem this way, though, is that it is possible that the integral \(\int_R f(x, y)dy\) does not actually exist for every x, and similarly \(\int_R f(x, y)dx\) does not exist for every y; Fubini‚Äôs theorem only asserts that these integrals only exist for <i>almost every</i> x and y. For instance, if f(x, y) is the function which equals 1 when y &gt; 0 and x = 0, equals ‚àí1 when y &lt; 0 and x = 0, and is zero otherwise, then f is absolutely integrable on R<sup>2</sup> and \(\int_{R^2} f = 0\) (since f equals zero almost everywhere in R<sup>2</sup>), but \(\int_R f(x, y)dy\) is not absolutely integrable when x = 0 (though it is absolutely integrable for every other</li>

<li>Normed space. Banach space
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Motivation:
<i>in many cases a vector space X may at the same time be a metric space because a metric d is defined on X. However, if there is no relation between the algebraic structure and the metric, we cannot expect a useful and applicable theory that combines algebraic and metric concepts. To guarantee such a relation between "algebraic" and "geometric" properties of X we define on X a metric d in a special way as follows. We first introduce an auxiliary concept, the norm (definition below), which uses the algebraic operations of vector space. Then we employ the norm to obtain a metric d that is of the desired kind. This idea leads to the concept of a normed space. It turns out that normed spaces are special enough to provide a basis for a rich and interesting theory, but general enough to include many concrete models of practical importance. In fact, a large number of metric spaces in analysis can be regarded as normed spaces, so that a normed space is probably the most important kind of space in functional analysis, at least from the viewpoint of present-day applications.</i></li>
<li>Definition <i>(Normed space, Banach space)</i>.
A <i>normed space</i> X is a vector space with a norm defined on it. A <i>Banach space</i> is a complete normed space (complete in the metric defined by the norm). Here a <b>norm</b> on a (real or complex) vector space X is a real-valued function on X whose value at an \(x \in  X\) is denoted by \(\|x\|\) and which has the properties: <br />
(Nl) \(\|x\| \geq 0\) <br />
(N2) \(\|x\| = 0 <=> x = 0\) <br />
(N3) \(\|\alpha x\| = |\alpha |\|x\|\) <br />
(N4) \(\|x+y\| \leq \|x\| + \|y\|\) <br />
here x and y are arbitrary vectors in X and &alpha; is any scalar. A norm on X defines a metric d on X which is given by
\[ \textbf{(1)	} d(x, y) = \|x - y\|;  (x, y \in X) \]
and is called the <i>metric induced by the norm</i>. The normed space just defined is denoted by \((X, \|\cdot \|)\) or simply by \(X\).</li>
<li>Remark 1:
The defining properties (Nl) to (N4) of a norm are suggested and motivated by the length |x| of a vector x in elementary vector algebra, so that in this case we can write ||x|| = |x|. It is not difficult to conclude from (Nl) to (N4) that (1) does define a metric. Hence normed spaces and Banach spaces are metric spaces.<br />
we notice that (N4) implies <b>(2)</b> \(\left| \|y\| - \|x\| \right| \leq \|y - x\|\) . Formula (2) implies an important property of the norm:
\[ \text{The norm is continuous, that is, $x \longmapsto \|x\|$ is a continuous mapping of $(X, \| \cdot \|)$ into $R$ .}\]</li>
<li>Remark 2:
<i>Can every metric on a vector space be obtained from a norm? The answer is no.</i></li>
<li>Lemma <i>(Translation invariance)</i>.
A metric d induced by a norm on a normed space X satisfies:<br />
(a) \(d(x+a, y+a)=d(x, y)\) <br />
(b) \(d(\alpha x, \alpha y) = |\alpha | d(x, y)\) <br />
for all \(x, y, a \in  X\) and every scalar \(\alpha\) .</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Further Properties of Normed Spaces
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Theorem <i>(Subspace of a Banach space)</i>.
A subspace Y of a Banach space X is complete if and only if the set Y is ciosed in X.<br />
*Note: <i>By definition, a subspace Y of a Banach space X is a subspace of X considered as a normed space. Hence we do not require Y to be complete. (Some writers do, so be careful when comparing books.)</i></li>
<li>Theorem (Completion 2). Let \(X = (X, \|\cdot\|)\) be a normed space. Then there is a Banach space X' and an isometry A from X onto a subspace W of X' which is dense in X'. The space X' is unique, except for isometries.<br />
*Note: The previous completion theorem <i>(completion 1)</i> implies the existence of a complete metric space X' = (X', d') and an isometry A: X &rarr; W = A(X), where W is dense in X' and X' is unique, except for isometries. Consequently, to prove the present theorem, we must make X' into a vector space and then introduce on X' a suitable norm.</li>

<li>Finite Dimensional Normed Spaces and Suhspaces
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lemma <i>(Linear combinations)</i>.
Let \(\{x_1,... ,x_n\}\) be a linearly independent set of vectors in a normed space X (<i>of any dimension</i>). Then there is a number c &gt; 0 such that for every choice of scalars \(\alpha_l, ... ,\alpha_n\) we have
\[ \|\alpha_1 x_1 + ... + \alpha_n x_n \| \geq c(|\alpha_1 | + ... + |\alpha_n |); (c > 0).\]
<i>Very roughly speaking it states that in the case of linear independence of vectors, we cannot find a linear combination that involves large scalars but represents a small vector.</i></li>
<li>Theorem <i>(Completeness)</i>.
Every finite dimensional subspace Y of a normed space X is complete. In particular, every finite dimensional normed space is complete.</li>
<li>Theorem <i>(Closedness)</i>.
Every finite dimensional subspace Y of a normel1 space X is closed in X.<br />
<b>Remark:</b> <br />
<i>Infinite dimensional subspaces need not be closed. For instance, consider the space of continuous functions X = C[0, 1] equipped with the maxnorm. Let Y be the subspace Y = span (1, t, t<sup>2</sup>, &#x2026;) of polynomials. The exponential function is in \(\overline{Y}\) but not in Y.</i></li>
<li>Definition <i>(Equivalent norms)</i>
<i>Another interesting property of a finite dimensional vector space X is that all norms on X lead to the same topology for X, that is, the open subsets of X are the same, regardless of the particular choice of a norm on X. The details are as follows:</i> <br />
A norm \(\|\cdot\|\) on a vector space X is said to be equivalent to a norm \(\|\cdot\|_0\) on X if there are positive numbers a and b such that for all \(x \in X\) we have
\[  a\| x\|_0 \leq \| x \| \leq  b\| x\|_0 .\]</li>
<li>Theorem <i>(Equivalent norms)</i>.
On a finite dimensional vector space X, any norm \(\|\cdot\|\) is equivalent to any other norm \(\|x\|_0\).</li>

<li>Theorem <i>(Compactness)</i>.
In a <i>finite dimensional normed space</i> X, any subset M &sub; X is compact if and only if M is closed and bounded.</li>
<li>Remark: <i>In R<sup>n</sup> (or in any other finite dimensional normed space) the compact subse~ are precisely the closed and bounded subsets, so that this property (closedness and boundedness) can be used for defining compactness. However, this can no longer be done in the case of an infinite dimensional normed space.</i></li>
<li>Theorem (Finite dimension). If a normed space X has the property that the closed unit ball \(M =\{x| \| x\| \leq 1\}\) is compact, then X is finite dimensional.</li>
<li>Theorem <i>(Continuous mapping)</i>.

<li>By definition, this is a bijective mapping of X onto X' which preserves the structure.</li>
<li>isomorphism T of a metric space is a bijective mapping which preserves distance.</li>

<li><b>Remark: <i>(The Converse of the Theorem of Lagrange is False)</i></b> Recall that the Theorem of Lagrange states that the order of a subgroup of a finite group G must divide the order of G. ex: although the group A<sub>4</sub> has 12 elements and 6 divides 12, A<sub>4</sub> has no subgroup of order 6.</li>

<li><b>Rings and Fields</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Definition:</b> A ring in which the multiplication is commutative is a commutative ring. A ring with a multiplicative identity element is a ring with unity; the multiplicative identity element 1 is called ‚Äúunity.‚Äù</li>
<li><b>Definition:</b> Let R be a ring with unity 1 &ne; 0. An element u in R is a <b>unit</b> of R if it has a multiplicative inverse in R. If every nonzero element of R is a unit, then R is a <b>division ring</b> (or <b>skew field</b>). A field is a commutative division ring. A noncommutative division ring is called a <b>‚Äústrictly skew field.‚Äù</b> <br />
ex: Q, R, C, and Z<sub>p</sub> for p a prime number are all fields.</li>
<li><b>Definition:</b> If a and b are two nonzero elements of a ring R such that ab = 0, then a and b are <b>divisors of 0</b> (or <b>0 divisors</b>).</li>
<li><b>Remark:</b> If R is a ring with unity and a is a unit in R, then a is not a divisor of 0. To see this, note that if \(ab = 0\), then \(a^{‚àí1}ab = 0\), so \(b = 0\). Similarly, if \(ba = 0\), then \(baa^{‚àí1} = 0\), so \(b = 0\). The theorem below shows that in the ring Z<sub>n</sub> every element is either 0, a unit, or a 0 divisor.</li>
<li><b>Theorem:</b> Let m &isin; Z<sub>n</sub>. Either m = 0, m is relatively prime to n, in which case m is a unit in Z<sub>n</sub>, or m is not relatively prime to n, in which case m is a 0 divisor in Zn.</li>
<li><b>Theorem:</b> <i>The cancellation laws hold in a ring R if and only if R has no divisors of 0.</i></li>
<li><b>Definition:</b> An integral domain D is a commutative ring with unity 1 &ne; 0 that contains no divisors of 0. <br />
<i>Thus, if the coefficients of a polynomial are from an integral domain, one can solve a polynomial equation in which the polynomial can be factored into linear factors in the usual fashion by setting each factor equal to 0.</i></li>
<li><b>Definition /(the characteristic of a ring):</b> If for a ring R a positive integer n exists such that n.a = 0 for all a &isin; R, then <b>the least such positive integer</b> is the characteristic of the ring R. If no such positive integer exists, then R is of <b>characteristic 0</b>. <br />
ex: The ring Zn is of characteristic n, while Z, Q, R, and C all have characteristic 0.</li>
<li><b>Theorem:</b> The set R[x] of all polynomials in an indeterminate x with coefficients in a ring R is a ring under polynomial addition and multiplication. If R is commutative, then so is R[x], and if R has unity 1 &ne; 0, then 1 is also unity for R[x]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>The Evaluation Homomorphisms</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Theorem <i>(The Evaluation Homomorphisms for Field Theory)</i>:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let F be a subfield of a field E, let \(\alpha\) be any element of E, and let x be an indeterminate. The map \(\phi_\alpha : F[x] \to E\) defined by
\[ \phi_\alpha (a_0 + a_1x + ...  + a_nx^n) = a_0 + a_1\alpha + ... + a_n\alpha^n \]
for \((a_0 + a_1x + ...  + a_nx^n) \in F[x]\) is a homomorphism of F[x] into E. Also, \(\phi_\alpha(x) = \alpha\), and \(\phi_\alpha\) maps F isomorphically by the identity map; that is, \(\phi_\alpha(a) = a\) for \(a \in F\). The homomorphism \(\phi_\alpha\) is <b>evaluation at</b> \(\alpha\).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Definition <i>(Irreducible Polynomials)</i>:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A nonconstant polynomial f(x) &isin; F[x] is <b>irreducible over</b> F or is an <b>irreducible polynomial in</b> F[x] if f(x) cannot be expressed as a product g(x)h(x) of two polynomials g(x) and h(x) in F[x] both of lower degree than the degree of f(x). If f(x) &isin; F[x] is a nonconstant polynomial that is not irreducible over F, then f (x) is reducible over F.</li>
<li>It is worthwhile to remember that the units in F[x] are precisely the nonzero elements of F. Thus we could have defined an irreducible polynomial f(x) as a nonconstant polynomial such that in any factorization f(x) = g(x)h(x) in F[x], either g(x) or h(x) is a unit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Prime and maximal ideals</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Theorem</b> Let R be a commutative ring with unity. Then M is a maximal ideal of R if and only if R/M is a field</li>
<li><b>Corollary</b> A commutative ring with unity is a field if and only if it has no proper nontrivial ideals.</li>
<li><b>Definition <i>(prime ideal)</i>:</b> An ideal N &ne; R in a commutative ring R is a prime ideal if ab &isin; N implies that either a &isin; N or b &isin; N for a, b &isin; R.</li>
<li><b>Remark:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The definition of a prime ideal may seem a little strange. It is, however, a natural generalization of the notion of a ‚Äúprime‚Äù in the integers Z. Let n be a nonnegative integer. According to the above definition the ideal nZ is a prime ideal provided n &ne; 1 (to ensure that the ideal is proper) and provided every time the product ab of two integers is an element of nZ, at least one of a, b is an element of nZ. Put another way, if n &ne; 0, it must have the property that whenever n divides ab, n must divide a or divide b. This is equivalent to the usual definition that n is a prime number. Thus the <i>prime ideals of Z are just the ideals pZ of Z generated by prime numbers p together with the ideal 0.</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Theorem</b> Let R be a commutative ring with unity, and let N &ne; R be an ideal in R. Then R/N is an integral domain if and only if N is a prime ideal in R.</li>
<li><b>Corollary</b> Every maximal ideal in a commutative ring R with unity is a prime ideal.</li>
<li><b>Theorem</b> Let R be a ring with unity. If R has characteristic n &gt; 1, then R contains a subring isomorphic to Z<sub>n</sub>. If R has characteristic 0, then R contains a subring isomorphic to Z.</li>
<li><b>Theorem</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A field F is either of prime characteristic p and contains a subfield isomorphic to Z<sub>p</sub> or of characteristic 0 and contains a subfield isomorphic to Q.</li>
<li>Thus every field contains either a subfield isomorphic to Z<sub>p</sub> for some prime p or a subfield isomorphic to Q. These fields Z<sub>p</sub> and Q are the fundamental building blocks on which all fields rest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Definition</b> The fields Z<sub>p</sub> and Q are <b>prime fields.</b></li>

<li><b>Ideal Structure in F[x]</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Theorem</b> If F is a field, every ideal in F[x] is principal.</li>
<li><b>Theorem</b> An ideal &lt;p(x)&gt; &ne; {0} of F[x] is maximal if and only if p(x) is irreducible over F.</li>
